# EnRoutePerformance
Python Packages:
$ conda install pymongo
$ pip install descartes
$ conda install baseman
$ conda install shapely


TO use the packages, please first unzip the files:

1. DependentData.zip
2. DependentData2.zip

Note:
1. DependentData2.zip is actually the output of GetEDA.py. Since we need to build mongodb to test the full function of GetEDA.py, I didn't do so in the testing phase. Considering FAA is using Oracle database, you may want to change the mongodb part to oracle. Thus, I just provide the output of GetEDA.py for IAH --> BOS case.
